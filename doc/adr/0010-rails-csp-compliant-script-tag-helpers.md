# 10. Rails CSP compliant script tag helpers

Date: 2021-10-22

## Status

Accepted

Supercedes [8. CSP compliant script tag helpers](0008-csp-compliant-script-tag-helpers.md)

## Context

The CSP controls and helpers used previously do not work when utilizing Rails UJS Ajax forms.

Rails UJS AJAX forms will be used by the TTA Activity Report linking code in order
to improve the error reporting experience.

## Decision

Using Rails built-in CSP controls while keeping SecureHeaders in place for other headers results
in a secure system that works seamlessly.

## Consequences

In order to define an inline `<script>` tag, use the `nonce: true` option.

```
<%= javascript_tag nonce: true do %>
  alert("my js runs here");
<% end %>
```

Please note that all of the pitfalls laid out in [8. CSP compliant script tag helpers](0008-csp-compliant-script-tag-helpers.md)
still apply to this helper.
