# 5. License

Date: 2021-08-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

This software should have a license which articulates how it may be used and modified, as well as what rights the authors may claim.

## Decision

We will use a CC 1.0 Universal public domain license. This is because [nearly all works created by the U.S. Government](https://www.usa.gov/government-works) are copyright-free.

## Consequences

Since this repository is in the public domain, we need to consider the licensing terms before incorporating contents whose rights would conflict with this resource's license. In that case, we will need to modify our license to make it clear that it does not apply to all of the contents of the repository.
