# Complaint Tracker

The Complaint Tracker is intended to connect complaints data across the OHS ecosystem for greater
visibility into status and actions taken to address a complaint.

## Development

### Local Setup

* Install Ruby 3.0.2
* Install NodeJS 14.18.0
* Install PostgreSQL 12.x: `brew install postgresql@12`
  * Add postgres to your PATH if it wasn't done automatically
  `echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/postgresql@12/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc`
  * Start the server
  `brew services start postgresql@12`
* Install Ruby dependencies: `bundle install`
* Install chromedriver for integration tests: `brew install --cask chromedriver`
  * Chromedriver must be allowed to run. You can either do that by:
    * The command line: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine $(which chromedriver)` (this is the only option if you are on Big Sur)
    * Manually: clicking "allow" when you run the integration tests for the first time and a dialogue opens up
* Install JS dependencies: `yarn install`
* Create database: `bundle exec rake db:create`
* Run migrations: `bundle exec rake db:migrate`
* Run the server: `bundle exec rails s`
* Visit the site: http://localhost:8080

#### Local Configuration

Environment variables can be set in development using the [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) gem.

Consistent but sensitive credentials should be added to `config/credentials.yml.env` by using `$ rails credentials:edit`

Any changes to variables in `.env` that should not be checked into git should be set
in `.env.local`.

If you wish to override a config globally for the `test` Rails environment you can set it in `.env.test.local`.
However, any config that should be set on other machines should either go into `.env` or be explicitely set as part
of the test.

#### Authentication

The Complaint Tracker is utilizing the HSES Staging environment for non-production authentication. If you need an account
reach out in the [#ph-ohs-oneteam](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/archives/C01TT2YNX0R) Slack channel for help in requesting one.

##### Bypassing HSES Authentication

HSES Authentication can be bypassed depending on the value of `RAILS_ENV`

| Environment | HSES Bypass |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| test | always bypassed |
| development | set `CT_BYPASS_AUTH` environment variable to `true` |
| ci | always bypassed |
| production | never bypassed |

When bypassing auth, you may use `CT_CURRENT_USER_UID` and/or `CT_CURRENT_USER_NAME` to override the current user's HSES name or username.

#### API Connections

API data will come from real APIs or the Api::FakeData depending on the value of `RAILS_ENV`

| Environment | Connects to Real API Endpoints |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| test | when `CT_USE_REAL_API_DATA` environment variable is `true` |
| development | when `CT_USE_REAL_API_DATA` environment variable is `true` |
| ci | never connects to real APIs |
| production | always attempts to connect to real APIs |

Documentation about the API specifications is available in [docs/api_integrations](/doc/api_integrations/README.md).

### Inline `<script>` and `<style>` security

The system's Content-Security-Policy header prevents `<script>` and `<style>` tags from working without further
configuration. See the [CSP compliant script tag helpers](./doc/adr/0008-csp-compliant-script-tag-helpers.md) ADR for
more information on setting these up successfully.

### Testing

#### Running tests

* Tests: `bundle exec rake spec`
* Ruby linter: `bundle exec rake standard`
* Ruby dependency checks: `bundle exec rake bundle:audit`
* JS dependency checks: `bundle exec rake yarn:audit`
* Ruby static security scan: `bundle exec rake brakeman`

Run everything: `bundle exec rake`

#### Manual tests

If you are testing manually, there are a couple features built into the fake data behavior to help you imitate errors.

- `/complaints?error=400` : Set the error parameter for the list of complaints to see how the app displays 400, 401, 403, and 500 errors
- TTA Activity Reports : Add an id ending with `-401`, `-403`, `-404`, or `-500` to a complaint to test these errors

### Set up automatic linting and testing

If you would like the linter to run before you commit, symlink `.githooks/pre-commit` to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`.

```bash
cd .git/hooks
ln -s ../../.githooks/pre-commit pre-commit
```

To bypass the hook in order to commit something that's not perfect yet,
run one of the following:

```bash
git commit -n  # --no-verify
```

## CI/CD

GitHub actions are used to run all tests and scans as part of pull requests.

Security scans are also run on a scheduled basis. Weekly for static code scans, and daily for dependency scans.

### Deployment

#### Staging

GitHub Actions are used to deploy to staging after any PR is merged into `main`.

Branch protection rules prevent any direct pushes to `main` or PRs from being merged into `main` until all tests and scans pass.

#### Production

TBD

### Configuring ENV variables in cloud.gov

All configuration that needs to be added to the deployed application's ENV should be added to
the `env:` block in `manifest.yml`

Items that are both **public** and **consistent** across staging and production can be set directly there.

Otherwise, they are set as a `((variable))` within `manifest.yml` and the variable is defined depending on sensitivity:

#### Credentials and other Secrets

1. Store variables that must be secret using [GitHub Environment Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-an-environment)
1. Add the secret to the `env:` block of the deploy action [as in this example](https://github.com/OHS-Hosting-Infrastructure/complaint-tracker/blob/a9e8d22aae2023a0afb631a6182251c04f597f7e/.github/workflows/deploy-stage.yml#L20)
1. Add the appropriate `--var` addition to the `push_arguments` line on the deploy action [as in this example](https://github.com/OHS-Hosting-Infrastructure/complaint-tracker/blob/a9e8d22aae2023a0afb631a6182251c04f597f7e/.github/workflows/deploy-stage.yml#L27)

#### Non-secrets

Configuration that changes from staging to production, but is public, should be added to `config/deployment/stage.yml` and `config/deployment/production.yml`

## Documentation

Architectural Decision Records (ADR) are stored in `doc/adr`
To create a new ADR, first install [ADR-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) if you don't
already have it installed.
* `brew install adr-tools`

Then create the ADR:
*  `adr new Title Of Architectural Decision`

This will create a new, numbered ADR in the `doc/adr` directory.

## Contributing

~This will continue to evolve as the project moves forward.~

* Pull down the most recent main before checking out a branch
* Write your code
* If a big architectural decision was made, add an ADR
* Submit a PR
  * If you added functionality, please add tests.
  * All tests must pass!
* Ping the other engineers for a review.
* At least one approving review is required for merge.
* Rebase against main before merge to ensure your code is up-to-date!
* Merge after review.
  * Squash commits into meaningful chunks of work and ensure that your commit messages convey meaning.

## Story Acceptance
