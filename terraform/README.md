# Terraform

## Set up a new environment

1. Set up a service key
    ```bash
    # login
    cf login -a api.fr.cloud.gov --sso
    # follow temporary authorization code prompts
    # select the desired OHS org and complaint tracker environment space

    # create a service instance that can provision service accounts
    # the value for < YOUR-NAME > can be anything, although we recommend
    # ct-<ENV>-deployer
    cf create-service cloud-gov-service-account space-deployer < NAME >

    # bind a service key to the service instance
    cf create-service-key < NAME > space-deployer-key

    # return a username/password pair for the service instance
    cf service-key < NAME > space-deployer-key
    ```
    `cloud-gov-service-account` and `space-deployer` are unique to cloud.gov and provide an account with the permissions to deploy your application. Read more in the [cloud.gov service account documentation](https://cloud.gov/docs/services/cloud-gov-service-account/).

1. Copy `terraform/<ENV>/secrets.auto.tfvars.example` to `secrets.auto.tfvars` and add the service key information from the above step
    ```
    cf_user = "some-user"
    cf_password = "some-password"
    ```
1. Run terraform with
    ```bash
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```

## Structure

Each environment has its own module, which relies on a shared module for everything except the providers code and environment specific variables and settings.

```
- <env>/
  |- main.tf
  |- providers.tf
  |- secrets.auto.tfvars
  |- secrets.auto.tfvars.example
  |- variables.tf
- shared/
  |- database/
     |- main.tf
     |- providers.tf
     |- variables.tf
```

In the shared module:
- `providers.tf` contains set up instructions for Terraform about Cloud Foundry and AWS
- `main.tf` sets up the data and resources the application relies on
- `variables.tf` lists the required variables and applicable default values

In the environment-specific modules:
- `providers.tf` lists the required providers
- `main.tf` calls the shared Terraform code, but this is also a place where you can add any other services, resources, etc, which you would like to set up for that environment
- `variables.tf` lists the variables that will be needed, either to pass through to the child module or for use in this module
- `secrets.auto.tfvars` is a file which contains the information about the service-key and other secrets that should not be shared
